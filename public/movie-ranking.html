<h1>Movies worth seeing</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies</h2>
<hr />

<h3>1. 10 Things I Hate About You</h3>
<p><strong>Classic</strong> Rom-Com. Need I say more?</p>
<br />

<h3>2. The Man from U.N.C.L.E</h3>
<p>Someone might think it's trash, but I'll gladly see it again and again.
    <br />
10/10 - guilty pleasure
</p>
<br />

<h3>3. Lemonade Mouth</h3>
<p>Possibly one of the best Disney-movies.<br />
